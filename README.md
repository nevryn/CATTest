Govroam CAT, the Configuration Assistant Tool
=============================================

This is a Govroam specific version GEANT's CAT tool. Essentially it's a
clone but with some of the pages rebranded with the Govroam name, URLs and
logo, and some of the text changed to be more suitable for public sector
rather than education.

CAT collects information about RADIUS/EAP deployments from Wi-Fi network
administrators and generates simple-to-use, good-looking, and secure
installation programs for users of these networks.  The goal is to vastly
improve the network security by pushing secure Wi-Fi settings to all users
without the need to expose them to or require them to understand all of the
underlying technologies and configuration parameters.

Govroam CAT User Manuals
------------------------
The Govroam CAT (https://cat.govroam.uk), has extensive documentation (with screenshots!) of CAT. You may want to read those for an overview of the features.

There is no documentation for end users, simply because it's so easy to use on the end-user side that no documentation is required! :-)

Installation and configuration of your own deployment
-----------------------------------------------------
With the production deployments as listed above, there are probably few use cases you would want to run your own installation. If you do want to deploy CAT yourself, the installation and configuration instructions can be found at [Configuration.md](tutorials/Configuration.md)

Previous Versions of CAT
------------------------
The 1.0.x and 1.1.x versions of CAT were developed on a SVN server of the GEANT project. Please refer to https://forge.geant.net/forge/display/CAT/Home for access to the source code and release tarballs of these earlier versions.
